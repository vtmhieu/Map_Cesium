# FINAL PROJECT at Hanoi University of Science and Technology

Hi! This is the project I developed to stream the 3D scenes into web.

In this project, I took the opensource of Cesium as the main base to develop

The data of objects, such as buildings, trees, roads,... all are taken from Openstreetmap.

After getting the .osm file from openstreetmap.com (you can modify the range of geometry that you want to gain data), use OSM2World to convert the .osm to .glTF (also opensource).
