A predicate that is used for filtering issues that are contained in a `ValidationResult`<!-- -->.

It receives the "stack" of issues, i.e. the path leading from the top-level issue through its 'causes', and returns whether the leaf issue (i.e. the last element of the issues stack) should be included in the filtered result.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ValidationIssueFilter = (issuesStack: ValidationIssue[]) => boolean;
```
