/**
 * Implementation of a `TilesetProcessor` that offers methods for
 * common operations on tileset data.
 *
 * The operations are applied by callbacks on certain elements
 * of the tileset data:
 *
 * - All tiles (as `TraversedTile` instances)
 * - Explicit tiles (as `Tile` instances)
 * - The tileset (and its schema) itself
 *
 * The operations may involve modifiications of the actual
 * `Tileset` object. The modified tileset object will be
 * written into the target when `end()` is called.
